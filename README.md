Designing a Social Networking Platform Like Twitter
The main purpose of this project is to design a social networking platform like twitter. A user is able to do all the activities available on any social media platform. Users can interact and connect with their friends by following each other, spread information by posting feeds on their timeline, chat and share photos.
 SQL has been implemented in this project which lets you access and manipulate databases. SQL executes the queries and has been used to insert data, update records, create new tables and delete some data from the tables.
To save time in the development process, entity relational diagrams and use cases have been used. This allows better understanding of the system and provides more efficient design process 
A user account is the basic building block in any social media account. As a user signs up for twitter, he or she is asked for the following information:
1.	Full Name
2.	Email Address
3.	Password
4.	Username
